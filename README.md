# azkar_gnome
Azkar for gnome shell desktop

this is a simple script written in Python to display Azkar as notification every 10 minutes

it works on any gnome shell desktop 

you can add or delete azkar as you want in the azkar list, also you can change time intervals 

to run it use azkar.sh file, and you can add it to startup apps to start on system load
thanks
